  - You can create variable in Makefile
    - `variable = value`

  - aggregation `sum, avg, min, max`
  - combine many tables
    - You need to take care of cartesian product
      - `where table1.columnid = table2=columnid`
    - `FROM table1, table2`
    - OUTER vs. INNER
      - OUTER is UNION
        - `FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2`
        - `FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2`
      - INNER is intersection
