# How the camera works

Converting reflected light to Image

1. A object is reflected by **light**.
2. The reflected light passes through the lens.
3. The lens collects the light to a image sensor.
4. Photodiodes in image sensor converts the light to electrical signal.  
   more light -> higher pixel value
5. A ADC converts the electrical signal to digital signal.  
   more light -> higher digital value
6. The digital signal is sent to the Image Signal Processor (ISP)
7. The ISP converts the digital signal to an **image**.

# Pixel

A pixel is a point on an image

One pixel represents a single color or a single contrast.

# Zero-based representation
