# Copy constructor

- copy constructor is called when an object is copied.
- copy constructor only has one parameter that is reference(`&`) to the original object.

```cpp
class ClassName {
    // we don't need to change the original object in this case -> `const`
    ClassName(const ClassName &other) {}
}
```
