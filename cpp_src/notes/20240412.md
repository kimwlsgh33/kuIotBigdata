# Inheritance (상속)

**Reusing** members of another class.

## base class & derived class

If you inheritance base class, you can access members of it except private members.

```cpp
class Point { 
  int x, y; 
public:
  void show();
};

class ColorPoint : public Point {
  string color;
public:
  void showColor(){
    // call base member function
    show();
  }
};
```

## up-casting

A pointer of base class can accept all of derived class.

up-casting is storing a address of a derived object as a base type
- you can use derived object like a base object

```cpp
ColorPoint cp;
ColorPoint *pDer = &cp;
Point *pBase = pDer;            // up-casting
// Point *pBase = (*pBase)pDer; // implicit casting
```

## down-casting

storing address of base object as a derived type
- you can specify a derived type to a base pointer
- you have to specify the class explictly.

```cpp
ColorPoint *pDer = (ColorPoint*)pBase;
```

# Protected

Protected members can be accessed by derived class unlike private members.

```cpp
class Point {
protected:
  int x, y;
};

class ColorPoint : public Point {
  string color;
public:
  void showColor() {
    cout << x << y << color; // this works!
  }
};

int main() {
  Point p;
  p.x; // this does not works...
}
```

# Constructor & Destructor on derived class

If you create a object by derived class, you will call constructors of both derived class and base class.
1. create a object.
2. call the constructor of the class.

condition - created objects class is derived by base class

1. derived class's constructor call the constructor of base class.
2. base constructor is executed.
3. derived constructor is executed.

## Specified Constructor

By default, compiler define constructor implicitly.

```cpp
B(int x) : A() {
  //...
}
```

You can specify the constructor of base class when you define derived class's constructor.

```cpp
B(int x) : A(x + 3) {
  cout << "B" << x;
}
```

# Kinds of Inheritance

By default, compiler specify the kind of inheritance as **priavate**

```cpp
class Derived : Base { ... };
```

## public

The public and protected members of base class remain the same.

## protected

The public and protected members of base class are converted to **protected**

## private

The public and protected members of base class are converted to **private**

# Multiple Inheritance

A single class can inherit multiple classes.

```cpp
class MP3;
class MobilePhone;
class MusicPhone : public MP3, public MobilePhone;
```

## ambiguous

```cpp
class BaseIO{ int mode; };
class In : public BaseIO;             // In has a `mode`
class Out : public BaseIO;            // Out has a `mode` either
class InOut : public In, public Out;  // In.mode and Out.mode, which one does the compiler choose?
```

# Virtual Inheritance

By virtual inheritance, a member of class can be defined only once.
- this can solve multiple inheritance's problem.

```cpp
class BaseIO{ int mode; };
class In : virtual public BaseIO;     // In has a `mode`
class Out : virtual public BaseIO;    // Out has a `mode` either
class InOut : public In, public Out;  // only In.mode be defined!
```
