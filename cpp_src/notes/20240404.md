# Dynamic Allocation (Heap) in C++

## new

`new` allocate a new memory space according to postfix type and return its address.

```cpp
int *pInt = new int;
int *pArr = new int [5];
int *pArr2 = new int [5]{1, 2 ,3 ,4};
```

`new` return `NULL` if you have rack of the heap memory

```cpp
int *pInt = new int;

if (!pInt) std::cout << "Not enough memory!!" << endl;
```

## delete

You can `delete` heap memory space.

```cpp
int *pInt = new int;
int *pArr = new int [5];
int *p = pArr;

delete pInt;
delete p; // this doesn't work
delete [] pArr;

```

## Why should we use Heap?

### Stack

```cpp
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

-> memory spaces are determined by developer of program
-> fixed size in developing time
-> determined at compile time
-> the size can be compiled

### Heap

```cpp
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]
```

-> memory spaces are determined by user of program
-> not fixed size in developing time
-> determined at runtime
-> the size cannot be compiled

# this

A pointer of object itself.
You need to distinguish member variables and local variables.
So, compiler store object's address into `this` pointer.

- you can use `this` to use object like variables.
- you can use `this` only in member function.

```cpp
void Circle::Circle(int radius) {
    this->radius = radius;
}

// preprocessed source file - implicit parameter `this`
Circle Circle::Circle(Circle *this, int radius) {
    this->radius = radius;
    return this;
}
```

# string class

- create my string class
- various method functions
