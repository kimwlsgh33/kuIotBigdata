# Call by...

## Value

Callee can't change the value of caller.

## Address

Callee can change the value of caller.

## Reference

Callee can change the value of caller.

# In C++, Call by...

## Value

```cpp
Circle waffle(30);
increase(waffle);

void increase(Circle c) {
    // create new local object of parameter (various sizes)
    // constructor doesn't work to reserve original object
}
```

## Address

```cpp
Circle waffle(30);
increase(&waffle);
void increase(Circle *c) {
    // create new local pointer (fixed size)
    // constructor doesn't work because it doesn't have to.
}
```

## Reference

Add a alias for variable into name space.

```cpp
Circle waffle(30);
increase(waffle);
void increase(Circle &c) {
    // create new name in name space
    // constructor doesn't work because it doesn't have to.
}
```

# Pointer vs Reference

## Nullability

- Pointers can be null.
- References can't be null.

## Assignment

- Pointers can be reassigned.
- References can't be reassigned.

## Dereferencing

- Pointers need to be dereferenced explicitly using `*` to access the value they point to.
- References are automatically dereferenced.

## Memory Management

- Pointers allow _direct memory manipulation_ and _dynamic memory allocation_ and _deallocation_ using `new` and `delete`
- References **do not allow** for dynamic memory allocation or deallocation directly.

## Pointer Arithmetic

- Pointers increase or decrease by a size of types
- Reference increase or decrease like a variable

# Copy

## Shallow Copy

Copy all by address

## Deep Copy

Copy all by value **recursively**
