# Electric components

## Capacitor
A passive electronic component that stores and releases electricl energy in the form of an electic field.

### Structure
conductive plate + dielectric + conductive plate

-> electric charges are accumulated...

### Usage

Filtering, Energy storage, Coupling, and Timing

## Inductor

Another passive electronic component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field when current flows through it.

### Structure
a coil of wire wound around a core made of a ferromagnetic material.

-> energy is stored in magnetic field...

### Usages

Filtering, Energy storage, impedance matching between circuits.
