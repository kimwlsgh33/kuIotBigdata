# Conduct
to act as a medium for conveying or transmitting

- Metals *conduct* electricity well.

# Conductor
A material or substance that allows electric current to flow through it easily.

# Insulator
A material or substance that has high electrical resistance, meaning it does not conduct electricity well.

# Semiconductor
A type of material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator.

## Conductivity Control

You can control conductivity of semiconductor by temperature, voltage, and impurities.

## The most common semiconductor
silicon, but other materials like germanium and gallium arsenide are also used.

## How semiconductors work

### Atomic Structure  
Semiconductors have a crystalline atomic structure,  
where each [atom](./atom.md) shares [electrons](./atom.md) with its neighboring atoms.

In pure form, semiconductors have a full valence band

#### Full valence band
The highest energy band containing electrons at absolute zero temperature.

##### Energy band
The distribution of allowed levels for electrons in a material.
