# GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output

# Pull up/down

pull down => 0V => 평상시 low
pull up => 5V => 평상시 high

전위차가 0.7V 이상이 되면, 도체가된다

아무것도 연결되지 않은 회로상태 -> floating state -> ground -> short

`I = V/R`
`P = IV`

# Serial Communication & 다중

## Serial Communication

Transmit data

### 단방향

TV, DMB

### 양방향

- Full-duplex (전이중)  
  선이 2개
  전화기

- Half-duplex (반이중)  
  무전기

### UART

Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

- 통신속도  
  시간당 전송량

## Peripheral Component Interconnect Express

# Sync & Async

## Sync

### Clock Signals

All devices share the same clock.
This clock dictate the timing of data transmission and synchronization between devices.

### High-Speed Data Transfer

Synchronous networks are often used in scenarios where
high-performance compting systems or synchronous communication protocols like Ethernet.

## Async

### No Common Clock

Data is transmitted asynchronously, meaning that each device operates independently with its own timing.

### Start/Stop Signal
