# Serial Communication

In Embedded System, Booting messages are displayed on the serial port

## UART

## I2C - Inter Integrated Circuit

Allows multiple devices to communicate with each other using just two wires

### Properties

- a data line (SDA - Serial Data)
- a clock line (SCL - Serial Clock)

### Key features

1. Two-wire communication

2. Master-slave architecture  
   Master: initiates communication
   Slave: responds to commands

3. Addressing  
   Each slave has a unique address to select and communicate with individual devices on the bus.

4. Clock synchronization  
   The master device generate clock signals to synchronize the slave devices.

5. Serial data transmission  
   Data is transmitted serially between devices.

## SPI

# Arduino

setup() is executed only once
loop() is executed forever
main() is hidden

## SERIAL_8N1

- 8 data bits
- no parity (no error detection)
- 1 stop bit
