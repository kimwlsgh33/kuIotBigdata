# A measure of the opposition to the flow of electic current.

## Impedance (Z)

A measure of the opposition that a circuit or component presents to the flow of alternating current (AC)

- It encompasses both resistance and reactance

- You can make impedance by **resistors**, [capacitors](./elec_comp.md) and [inductors](./elec_comp.md).


### Resistance (R)

A measure of the opposition that a circut or component presents to the flow of direct current (DC)

#### It caused by:

- the physical properties of a material
(its length, cross-sectional area, and resistivity)

- You can make resistance by **resistors** or **conductors**.


### Reactance

The opposition caused by capacitance of inductance

- Frequency can be vary because of these
