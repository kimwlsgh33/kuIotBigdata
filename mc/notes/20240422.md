# Check network status

```bash
# ping <IP address>
ping 89.0.142.86

netstat -tnlp
```

# Procedure

Protocol -> find a correspond Network ID

Network ID -> find a correspond Router

Host ID -> find a correspond Host

# Subnetting

# Port number

The process identifier to communicate with another processes.
(by the internet)

These port numbers range from 0 to 65535

## Well-Known Port (0 to 1023)

A reserved port for specific services and protocols.

FTP: 21

A port that is used by applications

## Dynamic or Private Ports (49152 to 65535)

For temporary connection

# Transmitting data by the Network

To communicate by internet, You should convert the Byte Order data into Network Byte Order

Network Byte Order == Big endian

## 0.0.0.0

Accept **any** address

1. default route, gateway (0.0.0.0)
2. loop back (127.0.0.1)
3. inet (163.152.224.123)

# _sockaddr_ vs _sockaddr_in_

## sockaddr

This is made to accept various protocols.

## sockaddr_in

This is made only accept IPv4 protocols.

# TCP/IP Stack (계층)

Stack means a open system (standard)

- Developer can implement thier own stack based on the standard
- User(another developer) can choose various stack

## Application Layer

## Transport Layer

The layer that use Ensure-Protocol

## Network Layer

The layer that use IP-Protocol

## Link Layer (wifi, ethernet) - Hardware
