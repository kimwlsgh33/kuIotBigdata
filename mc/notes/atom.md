# Atom
The basic particles of the chemical elements.

## Particles
A tiny part of things.

## Chemical elements
A chemical substance that cannot be broken into other substances by chemical reactions.

### Chemical substance
A unique form of matter with constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.

### Chemical reactions
A process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.

## Structure
nucleus of **protons** and generally **neutrons**, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons.

### Nucleus
The small, dense region consisting of **protons** and **neutrons** at the center of an atom

### Protons
A stable subatomic particle, symbol p, with a positive electric charge of +1 e(elementary charge)

#### Elementary charge
A fundamental physical constant defined as the *electric charge* carried by a single proton or, equivalently,
the magnitude of the negative electic charge carried by a single *electron*, which has charge -1 e.

##### Physical constant
== universal constant

A physical quantity that cannot be explained by a theory and therefore must be measured experimentally.

##### Mathematical constant
A fixed numerical value, but does not directly involved any physical measurement.

##### Electric charge
The physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field.

- This can be positive or negative

Like charges repel each other
Unlike charges attract each other
