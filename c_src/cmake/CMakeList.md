## Why do CMake exist?

- When you use `Makefile`, you should describe all the dependencies and the command that should be executed.  
  For this, you have to check every single file in your project.

- CMake can watch the source code and make a dependencies information

- You only need to describe the source file (c) and the target file (executable or library) for the entire project
