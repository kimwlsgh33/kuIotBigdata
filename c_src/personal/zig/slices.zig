// slice == a pair of `[*]T` (the pointer to the data) and a `usize` (the element count)
// Their syntax is `[]T`, with `T` being the child type.
// Slices are used heavily throughout Zig for when you need to operate on arbitrary amounts of data.
// Slices have the same attributes as pointers, meaning that there also exists const slices.
// For loops also operate over slices
// String literals in Zig coerce to `[]const u8`

// Here, the syntax `x[n..m]` is used to create a slice from an array.
// This is called slicing, and creates a slice of the elements starting at `x[n]` and ending at `x[m - 1]`.
// This example uses a const slice, as the values to which the slice points need not be modified.
