# Data Structure

## List

Unordered, allow duplication

```python
[1, 2, 3]
```

## Tuple

It's Like a list, but it's immutable (you can't change it after created)

## Set

Not ordered, Not duplicated

```python
s = set([1, 2])
s.add(3)
s.remove(1)

# union: |, intersection: &, difference: -
```

## Dictionary

Not ordered, Not duplicated

```python
dct = {1: 1, 2: 2}
dct[3] = 3
```

## Stack

First In Last Out (FILO)

- push, pop

## Queue

First In First Out (FIFO)

# Collection Module

## deque

Stack + Queue => Circle Linked List

#### methods

- append
- appendleft
- pop
- popleft

## OrderedDict

## defaultdict

You can initialize with default value

## Counter

## namedtuple

# Python style code (Pythentic)

## Split & Join (str)

You can split or join a string! - this is very common in Python

## List Comprehension

```python
# create odd list by using list comprehension
[i for in range(10) if i % 2]
```

# OOP

Object Oriented Programming

Class -> Object

- the class yield object as much as you want

```python
class Person:
    # initialize
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

## Inheritance

```python
class Child(Parent):
    super() # call the parent class
```

## `self` Pointer

`this` Pointer in another languages

# Polymorphysm

```python
class Parent:
    def method(self):
        pass

class Child(Parent):
    def method(self): # method overriding
        pass
```

# Visibility

You can hide something by using `__`

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name # public
        self.__age = age # private
```

## @property

```python
class Person:
    @property # you can access private
    def age(self):
        return self.__age
```

# Class variable

You can assign a class variable ( it's same as static variable )

```python
class Person:
    name = "John" # class variable
```
