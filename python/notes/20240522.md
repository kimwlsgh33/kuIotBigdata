# Threads in Python

## :lock: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

Python allows only one thread to execute Python **bytecode at a time per process**  
which simplifies memory management but limits parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.

#### Solution

Use **Multiprocessing** by `import multiprocessing`

It uses its own memory space and has its own Python interpreter and GIL  
allowing true parallel execution.

# elif

# loop

do not use parenthesis: ()

container -> range

while

# enumerate

# function

a context of code that process a specific task

## Function Call

A actual execution of functions

Python use **call by reference** (it's same to a call by address in c++)

## Arguments & Return Value

#### Keyword Argument

```python
# function call
print_something(my_name="TEAMLAB")
```

#### Default Argument

```python
def print_something(my_name="Default"){}

print_something()
```

#### Variable-length Argument

```python
def args_test(one, two, *args)
```

#### Keyword Variable-length Argument

```python
def kwargs_test(one, two, *args, **kwargs)
```

# Why use `"__main__"`?

To ensure the code is only executed when the script is run directly,  
and not when it is imported into another script.

# Scoping rule

variable definition with the same name in function allocate new variable

# Recursive

A way to call by itself

# Lambda

Inline function, Anonymous function

```python
lambda x, y: x + y
```

# Generator

A code that make iterator  
( without having to store the entire sequence in memory at once )

```python
def simple_generator():
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3

gen = simple_generator() #=> <generator object simple_generator at 0x000002>
print(next(gen)) #=> 1
print(next(gen)) #=> 2
print(next(gen)) #=> 3
```

## Advantages of Generator

- it's memory efficient & performant ( due to lazy evaluation )  
  it's particularly useful for big data processing

## Generator Expression

It's similar to list comprehension but use parenthesis instead of square brackes.

```python
gen = (x for x in range(3))

for value in gen:
  print(value)
```

# Decorator

A function that modifies the behavior fo another function or method by wrapping it.

They are executed at the time the function they decorate is defined, not when the function is called.

```python
def simple_decorator(func):
  def wrapper():
    print("Before")
    func()
    print("After")
  return wrapper

@simple_decorator
def print_something():
  print("Hello")

print_something()
#=> Before
#=> Hello
#=> After
```

# String

## methods

there are a lot of method in string class.

## f-string

## coding test
